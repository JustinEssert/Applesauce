# Applesauce

This project is designed for the use of the DoIT Tech Store at UW - Madison to
improve the flow of customers checking in computers for repair services.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use website that will take customers through a series of directed questions with the purpose of receiving a diagnostic on their computer. If a customerâ€™s computer requires a repair, the site will generate a check-in form that can be signed at the store. This allows the customer to simply stop by the DoIT Tech Store, drop off their computer, and sign the check-in form with little to no waiting for service or diagnostics.

### app/routes/api/
This website requires specific routers to make calls to the app's database in
order to retrieve the necessary data to run the app. Their are three main routers, described below:

#### answers.js
The answers router relates the following html calls, appended to **applesauce.doit.wisc.edu/api/answers**, with their corresponding database queries.

| HTTP call | Corresponding Database Query |
| --- | --- |
| GET / | SELECT * from answers |
| POST / | INSERT into answers (answer_id, question_id = req.body.q_id, answer_text = req.body.text, continue = req.body.cont, next_id = req.body.next_id) |
| GET /questionid/:id | SELECT * from answers WHERE question_id = req.params.id |
| DELETE /questionid/:id | DELETE FROM answers WHERE question_id = req.params.id |
| GET /answerid/:id | SELECT * from answers WHERE answer_id = req.params.id |
| PUT /answerid/:id | UPDATE answers SET question_id = req.body.q_id, answer_text = req.body.text, continue = req.body.cont, next_id = req.body.next_id WHERE answer_id = req.params.id |
| DELETE /answerid/:id | DELETE FROM answers WHERE answer_id = req.params.id |

#### questions.js
The questions router relates the following html calls, appended to **applesauce.doit.wisc.edu/api/questions**, with their corresponding database queries.

| GET /:id | SELECT * from questions WHERE question_id = req.params.id |
| PUT /:id | UPDATE questions SET question_text = req.body.text WHERE question_id = req.params.id |
| DELETE /:id | DELETE FROM questions WHERE questions_id = req.params.id |


#### repairs.js
The repair router relates the following html calls, appended to **applesauce.doit.wisc.edu/api/repairs**, with their corresponding database queries.

| HTTP call | Corresponding Database Query |

| GET / | SELECT * from repair |
| POST / | INSERT into repair (repair_id, definition = req.body.def) |
| GET /:id | SELECT * from repair WHERE repair_id = req.params.id |
| PUT /:id | UPDATE repair SET definition = req.body.def WHERE repair_id = req.params.id |
| DELETE /:id | DELETE FROM repair WHERE repair_id = req.params.id |
