# Applesauce

This project is designed for the use of the DoIT Tech Store at UW - Madison to
improve the flow of customers checking in computers for repair services.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use website that will take customers through a series of directed questions with the purpose of receiving a diagnostic on their computer. If a customerâ€™s computer requires a repair, the site will generate a check-in form that can be signed at the store. This allows the customer to simply stop by the DoIT Tech Store, drop off their computer, and sign the check-in form with little to no waiting for service or diagnostics.
