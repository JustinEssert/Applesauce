<p>
  Great! You've worked through configuring git and started a new git project. Now we'll explore more into commits and start learning about branches.
</p>
<h2>
  Part 1: Creating More Commits & Rolling-Back Code
</h2>
<p>
  In this part we want to learn how to roll back our code to a previous version, in order to do that though, we first must have multiple commits. We will start by creating a new commit, and then we will see how to roll-back to our first commit.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Before we do anything else, we should run <em>git status</em> to double check that everything that we've done has been recorded by git.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git status</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    You should see the message below, this means that git is up to date. We'll figure out what some of the other terminology here means in a short while.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal-out">
      <ul>
        <li>
          On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Great! Now, let's open up our example.html file and modify the third line to say <em>"Git is a great tool!"</em>.
    <div class="tab">example.html</div>
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl code">
      <ol>
        <li>&lt;h2&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h2&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
        <li><span class="indent">Git is a great tool!</span></li>
        <li>&lt;/p&gt;</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now again, we need to tell git that we've modified this file, so first we run a <em>"git add"</em> command. <br>
    Last time we ran <em>"git add example.html"</em>, but in general, you will have multiple files and will not want to add each file individually, it's just too slow. Instead let's get in the habit of using <em>"git add ."</em>, which adds all the files in our current directory (as well as any sub-directories).
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git add .</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now let's commit our change to git.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git commit -m "updated hello world message"</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless you have a reason for not doing so, it is often best to just get in the habit of pushing your code at the same time as you commit (recall that pushing code is just uploading to a GitHub repo).
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git push origin master</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now if we run <em>"git log"</em> again, we should see two commits.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git log</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    You're output should look something like this:
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal-out">
      <ul>
        <li>
          commit 91aa1d3e655a5bbc5a53aff8cc9c80bb5f48802e (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <br>
          <span class="indent">updated hello world message</span>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          commit eeba2040c5af96e20bfaa3a4448e8810fe6a249b
        </li>
        <li>
          Author: bbadger@wisc.edu
        </li>
        <li>
          Date: Mon Jan 1 11:00:00 2018 -0500
        </li>
        <li>
          <br>
          <span class="indent">created a example.html file</span>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now that we have another commit, we can see how to roll-back to our first commit.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first step in rolling-back to a previous commit is finding the <em>commit id</em> of that previous commit. The commit id can be found in the output of a <em>git log</em> command.<br>
    If we look to the example above, the first commit's id is "eeba2040c5af96e20bfaa3a4448e8810fe6a249b" and the second commit's id is "91aa1d3e655a5bbc5a53aff8cc9c80bb5f48802e". <br>
     <strong>Note:</strong> These are the commit ids in the example output shown above, your's will almost certainly be different so make sure that you get the correct id.
  </li>
  <li>
    To roll-back to the first commit we will use the <em>git checkout</em> command, followed by the first commit's id.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Again, make sure that you get your commit ids, don't copy straight from the example because yours will almost certainly be different.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git checkout eeba2040c5af96e20bfaa3a4448e8810fe6a249b</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    To check to see if this worked, we can now open up our example.html file and take a look at the third line.
    <div class="tab">example.html</div>
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl code">
      <ol>
        <li>&lt;h2&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h2&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
        <li><span class="indent">I'm doing a git tutorial!</span></li>
        <li>&lt;/p&gt;</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    If the third line says "I'm doing a git tutorial!" and not our updated "Git is a great tool!", then we know that we rolled-back successfully.
  </li>
  <li>
    This was a lot of work for a rather trivial result but imagine rolling back to a previous commit where hundreds or thousands of lines have been changed. Git makes it much easier to roll-back, as opposed to rewriting past code or using cmd-z a lot.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>
  Part 2: Introduction to Branches
</h2>
<p>
  Now imagine that we want to continue to use our rolled-back code, but we did not want to delete all of the work that we did prior to the roll-back. We can do this by creating a <em>branch</em>. <br>
  Like it's name implies, by starting a new branch we will create a new series of commits that branches off from our original work.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Let's begin by creating and navigating to a new branch<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The <em>git checkout</em> command is used for changing between branches or commits but the <em>-b</em> in this case tells git that we also want to create a new branch.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git checkout -b new-branch</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    This command creates a new branch called <em>'new-branch'</em> (clever name, I know).
  </li>

  <li>
    Now let's update our hello world message again, this time let's change the title to <em>"Hello Galaxy!"</em>.
    <div class="tab">example.html</div>
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl code">
      <ol>
        <li>&lt;h2&gt;Hello Galaxy!&lt;/h2&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
        <li><span class="indent">I'm doing a git tutorial!</span></li>
        <li>&lt;/p&gt;</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    Like always, we now need to add our updated files and commit our changes.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git add .</li>
        <li>git commit -m "changed title in example.html"</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    Now, if we want to push our code, we must also tell git that it needs to push to the new branch rather than the original one.<br>
    Before, we executed the command <em>"git push origin master"</em> where <em>"origin"</em> refers to the github url that we saved and <em>"master"</em> refers to the branch (so our original branch is called <em>"master"</em>). To push our code to our new branch, we must exectute the command <em>"git push origin new-branch"</em>.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git push origin new-branch</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now if we run <em>"git log"</em> again, we will see the same first commit and a different second commit.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The first commit is not a copy of our original first commit, rather new-branch and master share the first commit, and then 'branch' off into their own commits after the first commit.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      <ul>
        <li>git log</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    You're output should look something like this:
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal-out">
      <ul>
        <li>
