  <h2 class="uw-mini-bar" >Prerequisites:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This tutorial assumes very basic knowledge of how to use the terminal & shell (commands like cd and ls).
    <li>
      This tutorial is written on Mac OSX. If you are on a Windows or linux machine note that some material may be different (although git/GitHub terminology and commands should remain consistent across operating systems).
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="uw-mini-bar">What is Git?</h2>
  <p>
    Git is a <em>version control system</em>. This means that git is an extra tool that you can use as a developer to track changes and manage shared code between a group of people. Here are some examples of what Git enables you to do:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>You can have multiple different versions of your code
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example, you versions have two copies of code, one for the last fully-working update of your app and a second where you actively develop and debug new features.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Git also allows you to roll-back to a previous version of your code if necessary.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many young developers will comment out code instead of deleting it, for the fear that they may need to bring back the code at a later time. Git allows you to just delete any unneeded code and restore it later, if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            You don't have to <em>cmd-z</em> countless times to get back to a working version of your code; just use git to reset your code back to the latest working version.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Git makes it much easier to share code between multiple people in a team (we'll get into how at a later time).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Installing Git:</h3>
    <p>
      Installing git is as easy as openning up a terminal window and running the command <em>"git --version"</em>. If git is not already installed on your machine, a pop-up will appear asking if you would like to install git, press
      <strong>Install</strong> when prompted.
      <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
        <ul>
          <li>git --version</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </p>
<h2 class="uw-mini-bar">What is Github?</h2>
  <p>
    Github is an online service that allows you to create a <em>'remote repository'</em> for your team's code, think of this like a shared Google Drive folder, but specifically designed for code.
  </p>
  <h3>Signing up for GitHub:</h3>
    <p>
      Signing up for GitHub is as easy as navigating to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub's website</a> and following the directions on screen.<br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> GitHub offers some nice (and free) additional
      features  for students. If you're a student, I strongly recommend getting the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a> after creating your account.
