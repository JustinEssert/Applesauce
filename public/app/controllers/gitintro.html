<h2>Intro to Git and GitHub</h2>
<h3>What is Git?</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a <em>version control system</em>. This means that git is an extra
    tool that you can use as a developer to track changes and manage shared code
    between a group of people. Here are some examples of what Git enables you to
    do:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>You can have multiple different versions of your code
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example, you could have a copy of your code that you know works,
            as well as a version where you are adding a new feature, but the
            code does not work fully yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            This means that you don't need to comment out code that you don't
            want to delete, just delete it and if you need it later, you can
            still access it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Git also allows you to roll-back to a previous version of your code if
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Git makes it much easier to share code between multiple people in a
        team.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<h3>What is Github?</h3>
  <p>
    Github is an online service that allows you to create a <em>'remote
    repository'</em> for your team's code, think of this like a shared Google
    Drive folder, but specifically designed for coding.
