<h2>Git & Github Tutorial</h2>
<p>
  Now that you know a little about what Git & GitHub are, let's see how they
  look in action!
</p>
<h5>Part 1: Setting up a Git Repository</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    First off, open a terminal window (there are ways to use Git outside of
    using the terminal, but it is much easier and faster, once you get used to
    it, to use the terminal).
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a new folder called <em>git-tutorial/</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Within the <em>git-tutorial/</em> folder, create a file called
    <em>example.html</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open up example.html and copy in the following code.<br>
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl code">
      <p>
        &lt;h2&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
        &lt;p&gt;<br>
          I'm doing a git tutorial!<br>
        &lt;/p&gt;
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Save the file navigate to <em>git-tutorial/</em> in the terminal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Within the <em>git-tutorial/</em> folder, do the following command to create
    a git repository.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git init
    </div>
    You should receive a message that says you have initialized an empty
    repository in the git-tutorial folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Log in to GitHub and click on the button to <strong>Create a New Repository
    </strong>. On the next page, give your repository a name and mark it as
    private, then hit <strong>Create Repository</strong>.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong>Creating a public repository allows anyone be able to
    find your code. This is ok many cases, but for now we will just make a
    private one (you can delete it after this tutorial if you want).
  </li>
  <li>
    GitHub will now bring you to your repository's webpage, copy down the URL
    for the page, you will need this in a few steps.
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to back to the terminal window (you should still be inside the
    git-tutorial/ folder). Insert the following commands into the terminal,
    replacing "first last" with your first and last name, and "email" with the
    email that you used to create your GitHub account.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong>This will only have to be done once on your computer,
    this step involves telling git who you are and saving your user name and
    password to the computer. If you do not want to save your username/password,
    only do the first two commands.<br>
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git config --global user.name <em>first last</em><br>
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git config --global user.email <em>email</em><br>
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git config --global credential.helper store
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    One more configuration step that we need to do is tell git that we have
    created a online repository for our code. This is something that you only
    have to do once per repository. Replace <em>https://github-repository-url
    </em> with the URL that you copied down in a previous step.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git remote add origin
      https://github-repository-url.<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Let's take a break here, everything above this step was configuring git,
    GitHub, and your repository. These are not things that you will have to do
    very often, so just remember that they exist, but feel free to forget how to
    do it (you can always, and will have to sometimes, look up how to do these
    steps when you need to).
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, we are going to do something called a <em>git commit</em>, this is the
    process of saving your code to a git repository. You can ommit your code
    with the following code:<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The <em>-m</em> flag allows you to create a message
    describing what you did since the last commit in quotations, you should do
    this on every commit!<br>
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git commit -m "created a example.html file"
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we need to upload our code to GitHub. This can be done through a
    command called <em>git push</em>, as seen below.
    <div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl terminal">
      computer:git-tutorial user$ git push origin master
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Refresh your GitHub repository page and you should see your uploaded code!
  </li>
</ol>

.code {
  color: $ic-color-light,
  background-color: $ic-color-medium-lighter
}
.terminal {
  color: $ic-color-light,
  background-color: $ic-color-dark
}
