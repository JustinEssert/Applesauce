<h2>Installing Git and Signing Up for GitHub</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> These tutorials will be oriented towards mac users,
  everything that you need to do for Applesauce can be done on a Windows machine
  too, but it is easier to use a mac.

  <li><strong>Installing Git:</strong><br>
    Installing git is as easy as openning up a terminal window and running the
    command "git --version". If git is not already installed on your machine,
    a pop-up will appear asking if you would like to install git, press <strong>
    install</strong> when prompted.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Signing up for GitHub:</strong><br>
    Signing up for GitHub is as easy as navigating to
    <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub's website</a> and following the
    directions on screen.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> GitHub offers some nice additional features for
    students, so I strongly recommend getting the
    <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a> after
    creating your account.
